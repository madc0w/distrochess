	"faq_q1": "What's the big idea?",
	"faq_a1": "Distrochess is distributed chess. This means that you don't play a single game against a single person &mdash; you play many games against many other users. It's a bit like a simultaneous match, but instead of many people playing against a single opponent, there are several players on each side of the table.<br/> After you make a move, that game is placed back on the queue so that another user can have an opportunity to respond. Meanwhile, you will be given a random game off the queue. In order to avoid players playing against themselves, each player always plays the same side of a given game.",
	"faq_q2": "How is my Elo rating computed?",
	"faq_a2": "Your Elo rating is initially set to __initialRating__. When a game in which you have participated is decided, your Elo will change according to the <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elo-rating-algorithm/\">normal rules</a>, except that you will receive a proportion of the allocated points according to your ratio of participation in that game. The ratings of the black and white teams used for this calculation are determined as the average of all the ratings of the participants, weighted by their participation ratio.",
	"faq_q3": "Do games get flagged?",
	"faq_a3": "Yes, if no player has moved in more than __flagTime__ days, then the game is flagged. This means that it is recorded as a loss for the players whose move it is, and a win for the opposing players. This rule is to compensate for the fact that players may avoid games in which the chances of winning are slim in order to avoid reducing their score.",
	"faq_q4": "How do I resign or offer a draw?",
	"faq_a4": "Since you are just one member of your team, resigning or offering a draw would mean taking a decision your teammates might not agree with. This is problematic, so instead, Distrochess will simply adjudicate the game in the following conditions:<ul><li>One side has only a king remaining on the board.</li><li>The other side has either a rook or a queen.</li><li>This state has lasted for at least two moves.</li></ul>Draws are determined by the usual rules of chess (position repeated three times, insufficient material, etc.).",
	"faq_q5": "How do I know if I can capture en passant or if I'm allowed to castle?",
	"faq_a5": "It is is easier to ask forgiveness than permission. Just try! If it works, then you were allowed.<br/>If you think this information needs to be communicated, please <a href=\"mailto:distrochess@runbox.com\">tell me</a>, and I will happily implement a better solution.",
	"faq_q6": "I have a feature request/bug report.  What should I do with it?",
	"faq_a6": "Yes, I am very interested in your whatever it is.  Please send it to <a href=\"mailto:distrochess@runbox.com?subject=Distorchess feedback\">distrochess@runbox.com</a>.  I promise to respond.",
	"faq_q7": "Who made this, and why?",
	"faq_a7": "Distrochess is the brain child of <a href=\"mailto:distrochess@runbox.com\">Marc A. Donis</a>, who was just trying to avoid boredom. It is the reincarnation of an old idea, originally named Discochess back around 2008.<br/>I make no money from this project, and I don't care about your personal data. I do it for the love.<br/>Thanks goes to Chris Gilmore, for testing and DNS ninja skillz."
